# Explainable Fake News Detection and Personalised Credible Recommendation via GraphML

The proliferation of fake news on critical topics remains a persistent problem on the web. False information is often used as a means to spread hysteria and panic among readers who are gullible and seldom fact-check. Manual verification itself is a cumbersome task requiring extensive research and critical evaluation, making it time-consuming and impractical for everyday readers.

The objective is to develop a system that allows users to input the URL of a news article and receive a credibility assessment. The algorithm will (i) classify the article as ’real’ or ’fake’, (ii) provide an explanation for the decision, and (iii) recommend three relevant and safe alternatives, selected based on source reliability, content similarity, and user network popularity. This approach will make fact-checking time-efficient, transparent, and accessible.
